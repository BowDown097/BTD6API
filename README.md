## Dependencies
This project's IL2CPP modding functionality depends on [Il2CppInspector.](https://github.com/djkaty/Il2CppInspector)
## How to use in your project
- Click "Clone or download," and then "Open in Visual Studio" (if available) or "Download ZIP" if the aforementioned option is not available. Then, build the project. Alternatively, you can use the pre-built DLL in Releases. Afterwards, simply include the DLL in your project (if you don't know how to, [see here to learn how to do it in Visual Studio.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-creating-and-using-a-dynamic-link-library-cpp?view=vs-2019#create-a-client-app-that-uses-the-dll))
- To begin using your program, you will need this code.
  ```cpp
  // TODO: put code here whenever the API is done :)
  ```
- And that is all! You can use the Wiki or the examples in the Examples folder to learn what to do from here.
